                I can't believe it's already <span>Holiday</span>! I can't wait to put on my <span>Noun</span> and visit every <span>Place</span>
                in my neighborhood. This year, I am going to dress up as (a) <span>Person</span> with <span>Adjective</span> <span>Body Part (plural).</span>
                Before I, <span>Verb</span> I make sure to grab my <span>Adjective Noun</span> to hold all of my. <span>Food</span>
                Finally, all of my <span>plural noun</span> are ready to go!
                When <span>Famous Person</span> answers the door, I say,” <span>noun</span> or Treat!” Yum! I got (a) <span>Food</span> and (a) <span>food</span>.
                We visit <span>Number</span> houses and decide it’s time to <span>Verb</span> home. My <span>family member</span> says if I eat too much <span>Food</span>,
                 my <span>body part</span> will hurt, so I’ll east just <span>Number</span> pieces and go straight to bed. I hope I’ll have <span>Adjective</span>
                 dreams of <span>Plural Noun</span> tonight! Happy <span>Holiday</span>
